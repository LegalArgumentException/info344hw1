Requirements Write-Up

For this assignment, I don't think I quite understood what was meant by the setup being 70% of the work until I started setting up the EC2. After the large amount of time it took to set everything up, I finally appriciate just how much planning and work have to go into the creation of something (that seems) this simple. I first set up an EC2 instance via Amazon Web Services and ensured that I could host a simple "Hello World" page by using FTP to put the file up on the EC2 instance and using PuTTY to start the Apache instance. In order to get root acess and terminal into the EC2 Instance I had to make a private key. I then started a RDS MySQL relational database on AWS. Throughout this process I used XAMPP and phpMyAdmin to test out the database on my local machine instead of having to FTP after every change. In order to link the EC2 instance with the MySQL DB, I queried the database from PhP (making sure to use best practices to eliminate the possibility for SQL injection attacks). To make the website work and look up the names of players in real time, I used the jQuery library and made an AJAX search button that would refesh the player area without the user having to refresh the page. The php would convert the information it got from the server into a JSON object, which the JavaScript would then parse to get and displaythe information about individual players. I also made sure to query the DB in a way that would let the user type in the first name, last name, or a portion of a players name in order to see stats about them. If I had more time, I would've focused more on the CSS and layout of the site to make it a little easier on the eyes, but the general information is all there for the user to look up.
